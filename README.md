eyebrowse-2
===========

The concept of `eyebrowse` is to gather browsing history from participating users. Depending on the particular distribution, it may either be used in a context where the data goes into a public repository, or it may be used in a context where the data is shared in a controlled way (such as among a group of users, but not publicly). 

This implementation is a browser extension for Chrome and is currently in pre-alpha.

The project [eyebrowse-server](https://github.com/joshblum/eyebrowse-server) (also in pre-alpha) aims to build a server that can receive the data from users' installs of eyebrowse-2.

This wiki will be used as a set of working documents for current developers [swgreen](https://github.com/swgreen), [joshblum](https://github.com/joshblum), and [mjhu](https://github.com/mjhu).
